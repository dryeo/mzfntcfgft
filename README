   Dependent lib for Mozilla Cairo builds
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Setting it up
To make use of this package for compilation of a Mozilla build that makes use
of the cairo library, you need a GCC, and various other libraries and
environment variables set. Please follow the guide at
   http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/OS/2_Build_Prerequisites
how to do this.

Move the whole directory containing this package where you want it installed
and then run 
   make -s
   make clean
This compiles all files, links them into mzfntcfg.dll and adapts the
installation to your directory tree. Then it removes the unnecessary object
files.
(If for whatever reason you want to recompile everything, do
   make -s nuke all
   make clean
This comes in handy on GCC upgrades.)

Now be sure to also adapt the MZFNTCFGFT variable in your setmozenv.cmd, so
that this package can be used by the Mozilla build process. In case your
setmozenv.cmd does _not_ yet contain these variables add the
following lines:
  'set MZFTCFGFT=%ROOT%\mzfntcfgft'
  'set MZFTCFGFT2='backtoforward(value('MZFTCFGFT',,'OS2ENVIRONMENT'));


- Cairo files
The official sources of Mozilla (and the upstream cairo project) now contain
the sources for OS/2, both on the trunk and on the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. No
extra files should be necessary any more.


- Sources
The required source code is contained in this package. It is compiled from bits
of the packages
   expat-1.95.8
   fontconfig-2.3.2-os2
   freetype-2.1.10       (plus freetype security fixes)
These packages were drawn from Doodle's package
   ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/cairo-1.0.4-os2-src-with-dependencies.zip
the freetype security fixes come from the Gentoo freetype package (file
freetype-2.1.10-security_batch-r1.patch.bz2).


- Using this package
The Mozilla build setup automatically links the .lib files from the lib
directory where needed. No extra attention should be needed.


- Copyright
See mozftcfg.COPYING for copyright information. That file contains the required
copyright notes from all three base packages. If you plan to distribute a
Mozilla product that makes use of this package, please check about:license for
the copyright notes of the three packages.


- Contact person
If you want to complain please post to the group mozilla.dev.ports.os2 on the
newsserver news.mozilla.org.
