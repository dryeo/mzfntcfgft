   Dependent lib for Mozilla Cairo builds
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Setting it up
To make use of this package for compilation of a Mozilla build that makes use
of the cairo library, you need a GCC, and various other libraries and
environment variables set. Please follow the guide at
   http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/OS/2_Build_Prerequisites
how to do this.

Move the whole directory containing this package where you want it installed
and then run 
   make -s
   make clean
This compiles all files, links them into mzfntcfg.dll and adapts the
installation to your directory tree. Then it removes the unnecessary object
files.
(If for whatever reason you want to recompile everything, do
   make -s nuke all
   make clean
This comes in handy on GCC upgrades.)

Now be sure to also adapt the MZFNTCFGFT variable in your setmozenv.cmd, so
that this package can be used by the Mozilla build process. In case your
setmozenv.cmd does _not_ yet contain these variables add the
following lines:
  'set MZFTCFGFT=%ROOT%\mzftcfgft'
  'set MZFTCFGFT2='backtoforward(value('MZFTCFGFT',,'OS2ENVIRONMENT'));


- Cairo files
As the official cairo (and hence Mozilla) sources don't yet contain cairo for
OS/2, you have to copy the files from one of the cairo_* subdirectories into
your mozilla tree at
   mozilla\gfx\cairo\cairo\src
When doing that be sure to overwrite the existing cairo-features.h.in and
cairo.h files, otherwise OS/2 will not be picked up. In addition, you may need
to adapt one of the patches from
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342644
to get Mozilla building with cairo. If you are building from the 1.8 branch you
don't need to do anything, cairo for OS/2 is included there.


- Sources
The required source code is contained in this package. It is compiled from bits
of the packages
   expat-1.95.8
   fontconfig-2.3.2-os2
   freetype-2.1.10       (plus freetype security fixes)
These packages were drawn from Doodle's package
   ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/cairo-1.0.4-os2-src-with-dependencies.zip
the freetype security fixes come from the Gentoo freetype package (file
freetype-2.1.10-security_batch-r1.patch.bz2).


- Using the DLL
If you built a Mozilla application with SVG support, you will not be able to
start it until you place mozftcfg.dll into the LIBPATH or the program
directory. If you want to ship a program linked against this DLL, the best will
be to copy both mozftcfg.COPYING and mozftcfg.dll into the program directory in
the package.


- Copyright
See mozftcfg.COPYING for copyright information. That file contains the required
copyright notes from all three base packages. For the included cairo files,
please see cairo.COPYING, cairo.COPYING-MPL-1.1, cairo.COPYING-LGPL-2.1. The
OS/2 cairo files are from Doodle's OS/2 port (v.1.0.4 for Mozilla 1.8.0 branch
and v.1.2.2 for the trunk).


- Contact person
If you want to complain please post to the group mozilla.dev.ports.os2 on the
newsserver news.mozilla.org.
