   Dependent lib for Mozilla Cairo builds
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Setting it up
To make use of this package for compilation of a Mozilla build that makes use
of the cairo library, you need a GCC, and various other libraries and
environment variables set. Please follow the guide at
   http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/OS/2_Build_Prerequisites
how to do this.

Move the whole directory containing this package where you want it installed
and then run
   make -s
   make clean
This compiles all files, collects the object files into mzfntcfg.lib and mozft.lib
and adapts the installation to your directory tree. Then it removes the unnecessary
object files.
(If for whatever reason you want to recompile everything, do
   make -s nuke all
   make clean
This comes in handy on GCC upgrades.)

Now be sure to also adapt the MZFNTCFGFT variable in your setmozenv.cmd, so
that this package can be used by the Mozilla build process. In case your
setmozenv.cmd does _not_ yet contain these variables add the
following lines:
  'set MZFTCFGFT=%ROOT%\mzfntcfgft'
  'set MZFTCFGFT2='backtoforward(value('MZFTCFGFT',,'OS2ENVIRONMENT'));


- Sources
The required source code is contained in this package. It is compiled from bits
of the packages
   fontconfig           (the Netlabs version by ErOs2 and Doodle)
   fontconfig-2.3.2-os2 (only the header files of the original Fontconfig package)
Both are part of the *dependencies* packages on <ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/>.
   ft234.zip            (from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3157&package_id=3121)
Differences from the default configuration of FreeType (in the header files in
include\freetype\config are marked with PmW.


- Using the DLL
If you built a Mozilla application with SVG support, you will not be able to
start it until you place mzfntcfg.dll into the LIBPATH or the program
directory. If you want to ship a program linked against this DLL, the best will
be to copy both mzfntcfg.COPYING and mzfntcfg.dll into the program directory in
the package.


- Copyright
See mzfntcfg.COPYING for copyright information. That file contains the required
copyright notes from both base packages.
