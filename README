   Dependent lib for Mozilla Cairo builds
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Setting it up
To make use of this package for compilation of a Mozilla build that
makes use of the cairo library, you need a GCC, and various other
libraries and environment variables set. Please follow the guide at
<http://www.mozilla.org/ports/os2/gccsetup.html> how to do this. In
particular you will need to adapt the setmozenv.cmd script to your
environment.

Move the whole directory containing this package where you want it
installed and then run 
   make -s
   make clean
This compiles all files, links them into mzfntcfg.dll and adapts the
installation to your directory tree. Then it removes the unnecessary
object files.
(If for whatever reason you want to recompile everything, do
   make -s nuke all
   make clean
This comes in handy on GCC upgrades.)

Now be sure to also adapt the MZFNTCFGFT variable in your setmozenv.cmd,
so that this package can be used by the Mozilla build process. In case
your setmozenv.cmd does _not_ yet contain these variables add the
following lines:

  'set MZFTCFGFT=%ROOT%\mzftcfgft'
  'set MZFTCFGFT2='backtoforward(value('MZFTCFGFT',,'OS2ENVIRONMENT'));


- Cairo files
As the official cairo (and hence Mozilla) sources don't yet contain
cairo for OS/2, you have to copy the files from one of the cairo_*
subdirectories into your mozilla tree at
   mozilla\gfx\cairo\cairo\src
When doing that be sure to overwrite the existing cairo-features.h.in
and cairo.h files, otherwise OS/2 will not be picked up. In addition,
you may need to adapt one of the patches from
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342644
to get Mozilla building with cairo.


- Sources
The required source code is contained in this package. It is compiled
from bits of the packages
   expat-1.95.8
   fontconfig-2.3.2-os2
   freetype-2.1.10       (plus freetype security fixes)
These packages were drawn from Doodle's package
   ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/cairo-1.0.4-os2-src-with-dependencies.zip
the freetype security fixes come from the Gentoo freetype package (file
freetype-2.1.10-security_batch-r1.patch.bz2).


- Copyright
See mozftcfg.COPYING for copyright information. That file contains the
required copyright notes from all three base packages. If you want to
ship a Mozilla build containing cairo, please be sure to copy both 
mozftcfg.COPYING and mozftcfg.dll into the program directory.
For the included cairo files, please see cairo.COPYING, cairo.COPYING-MPL-1.1,
cairo.COPYING-LGPL-2.1. The OS/2 cairo files are from Doodle's OS/2 port.


- Contact person
If you want to complain please post to the group mozilla.dev.ports.os2
on the newsserver news.mozilla.org.
